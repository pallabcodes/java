Sure! Let's take a medium-level LeetCode problem and go through each step mentioned in the approach. We'll use "3Sum" (LeetCode Problem #15) as our example.

### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

#### 1. Read the Problem Statement Carefully

- Ensure you understand the requirements: Find triplets in the array that sum to zero.
- Identify inputs: an integer array `nums`.
- Identify outputs: a list of lists containing the triplets.

#### 2. Visualize the Problem

- Drawing the problem helps clarify the requirement. For instance, for `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`, you can visualize pairs and their sums to see which combinations might work.

```
nums: [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
possible triplets: [-1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 2], ...
```

#### 3. Write Pseudocode

- Plan your steps in plain language before coding.

```
sort(nums)
initialize result list
for each index i in nums:
    if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1], continue to next i
    set left to i + 1, right to last index
    while left < right:
        calculate current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == 0, add triplet to result, move left and right pointers
        if current_sum < 0, move left pointer right
        if current_sum > 0, move right pointer left
return result list
```

#### 4. Break Down the Problem

- Split the task into smaller steps.
  1. **Sort the Array**: Makes it easier to avoid duplicates and manage the pointers.
  2. **Use Three Pointers**: One for each element in the triplet.
  3. **Avoid Duplicates**: Skip duplicate values to ensure unique triplets.
  4. **Move Pointers**: Adjust pointers based on the sum.

#### 5. Identify Edge Cases

- An empty array or an array with less than three elements.
- Arrays where no triplets sum to zero.

#### 6. Think of Data Structures and Algorithms

- Sorting the array first simplifies the two-pointer approach.
- Using a list to store results ensures we return the correct format.

### Code Implementation

```python
def threeSum(nums):
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            if current_sum == 0:
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left - 1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right + 1]:
                    right -= 1
            elif current_sum < 0:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
    return result
```

### Summary

- **Read Carefully**: Understand the problem requirements and constraints.
- **Visualize**: Use diagrams to see how elements can form triplets.
- **Pseudocode**: Plan your solution in plain language.
- **Break Down**: Tackle smaller parts of the problem sequentially.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider special scenarios and ensure they are handled.
- **Data Structures**: Use sorting and two-pointer techniques for efficient solutions.

By following these steps, you can systematically approach and solve new or unknown LeetCode problems.

Let's take a hard-level LeetCode problem and go through each step mentioned in the approach. We'll use "Merge k Sorted Lists" (LeetCode Problem #23) as our example.

### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

#### 1. Read the Problem Statement Carefully

- Ensure you understand the requirements: Merge `k` sorted linked-lists into one sorted linked-list.
- Identify inputs: an array of `k` linked-lists.
- Identify outputs: a single merged and sorted linked-list.

```
lists: [[1,4,5], [1,3,4], [2,6]]
merged: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
```

#### 3. Write Pseudocode

- Plan your steps in plain language before coding.

```
initialize a min-heap
for each linked list, add the head node to the heap
initialize a dummy node to build the result list
while the heap is not empty:
    extract the minimum node from the heap
    add this node to the result list
    if the extracted node has a next node, add the next node to the heap
return the result list starting from the dummy node's next
```

#### 4. Break Down the Problem

- Split the task into smaller steps.
  1. **Initialize a Min-Heap**: To always extract the minimum element efficiently.
  2. **Add Head Nodes**: Add the head nodes of all linked-lists to the heap.
  3. **Extract Min and Add to Result**: Continuously extract the smallest node and add it to the result list.
  4. **Add Next Nodes**: If the extracted node has a next node, add it to the heap.

#### 5. Identify Edge Cases

- An empty array of lists.
- Lists where some or all linked-lists are empty.

#### 6. Think of Data Structures and Algorithms

- Use a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently get the minimum element.
- Use a linked-list to store the result.

### Code Implementation

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop
from typing import List, Optional

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.val < other.val

def mergeKLists(lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    min_heap = []
    for l in lists:
        if l:
            heappush(min_heap, l)

    dummy = ListNode()
    current = dummy

    while min_heap:
        smallest_node = heappop(min_heap)
        current.next = smallest_node
        current = current.next
        if smallest_node.next:
            heappush(min_heap, smallest_node.next)

    return dummy.next
```

Your approach outlines a solid problem-solving method, but let's add a bit more structure to help you systematically deduce the steps needed. Here's a more detailed breakdown of a systematic approach you can follow:

### Systematic Approach to Problem Solving

1. **Understand the Problem:**

- **Carefully read the problem statement.**
- **Identify input and output:** Note the data types and structures.
- **Constraints and edge cases:** Pay attention to any special conditions or limits.

2. **Explore Examples:**

- **Work through simple examples:** Understand how the problem behaves with basic input.
- **Identify patterns:** Look for repeated operations or structures in the examples.

3. **Choose an Initial Approach:**

- **Start with brute force:** Ensure you can solve the problem in a straightforward way.
- **Check correctness:** Make sure the brute force solution produces the correct output for all test cases.

4. **Optimize the Approach:**

- **Identify inefficiencies:** Look at your brute force solution to find areas that can be improved.
- **Choose the right technique:** Decide on an algorithm or data structure that fits the problem (e.g., sliding window, two pointers, dynamic programming, etc.).
- **Break down the solution:** Create a step-by-step plan for the optimized approach.

5. **Write Pseudocode:**

- **Outline the logic:** Convert your step-by-step plan into pseudocode to clarify your thoughts.

6. **Implement the Solution:**

- **Translate pseudocode into code:** Write the actual code for your solution.
- **Use meaningful variable names:** Make your code readable and maintainable.

7. **Test the Solution:**

- **Run test cases:** Use a variety of inputs, including edge cases.
- **Debug as needed:** Fix any issues that arise during testing.

8. **Review and Refine:**

- **Analyze performance:** Consider the time and space complexity.
- **Refactor if needed:** Make the code cleaner and more efficient if possible.

### Example: Applying the Systematic Approach ↓↓

**Problem: Find the longest substring without repeating characters.**

1. **Understand the Problem:**

- Input: A string `s`.
- Output: An integer representing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
- Constraints: The length of the string can be up to 10^5.

2. **Explore Examples:**

- Example: For `s = "abcabcbb"`, the longest substring without repeating characters is `"abc"` with length 3.
- Example: For `s = "bbbbb"`, the longest substring without repeating characters is `"b"` with length 1.

3. **Choose an Initial Approach:**

- Brute force: Check all substrings and determine if they have repeating characters. This is not efficient but helps understand the problem.

4. **Optimize the Approach:**

- **Sliding Window + HashMap:**
  - Initialize `start`, `end`, and `maxLength`.
  - Use a hash map to track characters and their positions.
  - Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer.
  - If a character is repeated, move the `start` pointer.
  - Update `maxLength` as needed.

5. **Write Pseudocode:**

   ```text
   Initialize start = 0, end = 0, maxLength = 0
   Initialize charMap as an empty dictionary

   For end from 0 to length of s:
       If s[end] is in charMap:
           Move start to max(start, charMap[s[end]] + 1)
       Update charMap with s[end] = end
       Update maxLength to max(maxLength, end - start + 1)

   Return maxLength
   ```

6. **Implement the Solution:**

   ```python
   def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
       charMap = {}
       start = 0
       maxLength = 0

       for end in range(len(s)):
           if s[end] in charMap:
               start = max(start, charMap[s[end]] + 1)
           charMap[s[end]] = end
           maxLength = max(maxLength, end - start + 1)

       return maxLength
   ```

7. **Test the Solution:**

- Test with various inputs: `"abcabcbb"`, `"bbbbb"`, `"pwwkew"`, `""`, `"a"`, `" "`, `"au"`.
- Ensure all edge cases are covered and the output is correct.

8. **Review and Refine:**

- Analyze the complexity: The time complexity is O(n) because each character is processed at most twice.
- Ensure the code is clean and maintainable.

By following this structured approach, you'll have a clearer path to solving problems and can systematically deduce the steps needed for a solution.

### Tips for Determining the Approach for any DSA problem

It's completely normal to struggle with identifying the optimal approach (Step 4) when solving algorithmic problems, especially if you're still gaining experience in problem-solving techniques. Here are some tips that can help you improve your ability to determine the right approach:

### Tips for Determining the Approach

1. **Practice and Familiarity:**

- The more problems you solve, the more familiar you'll become with common techniques like sliding window, two pointers, hash maps, etc.
- Reviewing solutions and explanations for different types of problems can help build your understanding.

2. **Identify Patterns:**

- Look for keywords or phrases in the problem statement that might suggest a particular approach (e.g., "subarray" might hint at a sliding window).
- Recognize similar problems you've solved before and apply similar techniques.

3. **Start with Brute Force:**

- If you're unsure of the optimal approach, begin with a straightforward brute force solution.
- This can help you understand the problem better and often leads to insights on how to optimize.

4. **Consider Constraints and Trade-offs:**

- Evaluate the constraints of the problem (e.g., time complexity, space complexity).
- Choose an approach that balances efficiency with clarity and ease of implementation.

5. **Break Down the Problem:**

- Break the problem into smaller parts or subproblems.
- Think about how you would solve each part individually and then integrate them into a cohesive solution.

6. **Draw Diagrams or Use Examples:**

- Visual aids such as diagrams or examples can help you understand the problem better and brainstorm potential solutions.

7. **Discuss and Collaborate:**

- Discussing problems with others or reading different approaches can provide new perspectives and insights.
- Online forums, coding communities, or study groups can be valuable resources.

### Example Application

Let's apply these tips to the problem of finding the longest substring without repeating characters:

1. **Understand the Problem:**

- Input: A string `s`.
- Output: An integer representing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

2. **Explore Examples:**

- Example: For `s = "abcabcbb"`, the longest substring without repeating characters is `"abc"` with length 3.
- Example: For `s = "bbbbb"`, the longest substring without repeating characters is `"b"` with length 1.

3. **Start with Brute Force:**

- Check all possible substrings and determine if they contain repeating characters. This might involve nested loops and isn't optimal but can provide insights.

4. **Optimize the Approach (Sliding Window + HashMap):**

- Identify the need to track characters and their positions using a hash map (`charMap`).
- Use a sliding window approach with two pointers (`start` and `end`) to efficiently find the longest substring without repeating characters.

5. **Write Pseudocode:**

   ```text
   Initialize start = 0, end = 0, maxLength = 0
   Initialize charMap as an empty dictionary

   For end from 0 to length of s:
       If s[end] is in charMap:
           Move start to max(start, charMap[s[end]] + 1)
       Update charMap with s[end] = end
       Update maxLength to max(maxLength, end - start + 1)

   Return maxLength
   ```

6. **Implement the Solution:**

   ```python
   def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
       charMap = {}
       start = 0
       maxLength = 0

       for end in range(len(s)):
           if s[end] in charMap:
               start = max(start, charMap[s[end]] + 1)
           charMap[s[end]] = end
           maxLength = max(maxLength, end - start + 1)

       return maxLength
   ```

7. **Test and Refine:**

- Test the solution with different inputs and edge cases.
- Ensure the code handles all scenarios correctly and efficiently.

### Practice Makes Progress

Remember, problem-solving is a skill that improves with practice and persistence. As you work through more problems and analyze different approaches, you'll become more adept at identifying patterns and determining the most suitable techniques. Don't hesitate to review explanations and seek help when needed—it's all part of the learning process!

#### Generalized Steps to solve any programming problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roanIWKtGMY&t=358s&ab_channel=NeetCodeIO

1. *Understanding problem (I can imagine/map it to the real world situation i.e. related/unrelated strictly + visualize) + *test or simplified inputs + time constraints (skip or not) + keywords (if given)

2. Is output explicit or implicit? Some answer is explicitly given (or part of the input), otherwise need to find the output (visually) and when doing it I will be able to find out STEP(s) and required algo/patterns `This is a must STEP`

N.B: [ during the STEP 2 if stuck i.e. can't get to the output with my approach(es) (that could be vary for each person e.g. 10/15/20/30min ]; write comments on things I am unable to solve & now straight up look for solution ↓

N.B: Even If I look at the solution; I must ensure 2 things 1) why developer opt for this (data structure and algo) in this way to solve my commented queries? 2) Understand enough to apply to another problem later (although this may or may not another problem like this)

3. Divide the problem into smaller ones or individual steps and each step could utilize (a. example inputs b. are helper/additional data structure(s)/algo(s) needed? c. possible cases and edge cases d. pseudocode)

4. Get Unstuck - Fix Bugs/Errors (even if i need to look at solution a. why does the solution work? b. what could be the intuition/thought process to come up with this solution?)

## How to build intuition ?

ask chatgpt: since "Numbers with same consecutive differences" question doesn't really explicitly say anything about to use DFS, how should I build to intuition or think to use DFS + backtracking?

ask chatgpt: Understand the Benefits of DFS and Backtracking like this list out the benefits of all and most common data structure and their relative algorithms/leetcode and when they are used especially when the question doesn't say anything explicitly

ask chatgpt: Understand the Benefits of DFS and Backtracking like this list out the benefits of all and most common algorithms/leetcode and when they are used especially when the question doesn't say anything explicitly

These are my opinions.

- My first thought on this is. If you can sort without moving those in the banned position. Though that was wrong.

  1.) The importance of simplifying or making a problem understandable.
  I bet most people spend 30 mins or more just figuring out the problem statement.
  1.2) The importance of naming things.  
  Like maybe banned is actually called banned_index or k should be called differently.
  2.) Good examples are a must. I don't know if this is hard because of bad examples or bad because of too few good examples.
  3.) Companies should understand not everyone wants to be a competitive programmer or want to be a leetcode solver.
  It's fine if you want it. But don't make it a priority for qualification.
  DS and Algo should be prioritize more.
  4.) The benefit for the problem. If you give this type of problem to your applicants. Is there a benefit if someone solves this problem?
  Or are you just giving hard problem for the sake of it? If your company always or most of the times encounter this problem go for it.
  But if not, it is just a waste of time for you and your applicants.

### Strategies for Mastering Fibonacci-Based Recursion

1. **Understand the Recursive Structure:**

   - Recognize problems where the solution builds incrementally, similar to Fibonacci, where the nth solution depends on previous solutions.

2. **Apply Memoization:**

   - Use memoization to cache intermediate results, optimizing recursive solutions by avoiding redundant calculations.

3. **Identify Overlapping Subproblems:**

   - Look for subproblems that recur frequently and can be solved once and reused, a hallmark of dynamic programming.

4. **Practice Optimal Substructure:**

   - Ensure that the problem exhibits optimal substructure, where optimal solutions of subproblems can construct an optimal solution for the whole.

5. **Use Dynamic Programming Iteratively:**
   - Transition from recursive to iterative dynamic programming to improve time and space efficiency for large inputs.

### Tips for Solving These Problems

- **Start with Base Cases:** Clearly define base cases to avoid infinite recursion and ensure correctness.
- **Think Recursively:** Break down the problem into smaller subproblems and think about how they build up to the solution.
- **Use Visual Aids:** Draw recursion trees or state diagrams to visualize problem-solving strategies and understand recursion flow.
- **Optimize with Memoization:** Implement memoization or tabulation to optimize solutions by storing and reusing previously computed results.
- **Test Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases and constraints to ensure robustness and handle special scenarios correctly.

By working through these problems and understanding their underlying recursive structure, you'll develop a strong grasp of when and how to apply Fibonacci-based recursion in various problem-solving contexts.
